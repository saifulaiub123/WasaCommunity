# Wasa Community 
Wasa Community is used as a tool for connecting every employee of Wasa Sweden AB no matter where that person is located geographically. This tool is meant to replace several different functions that today exists in different places (Instant messaging in Skype, Data-visualization in Pyramid, Alert-messaging in Outlook). Wasa Community gathers these functions in one place where everything is easily accessible, and easy to use. It also adds new functionality to easily get an overview of every employees schedule, and whether or not they are busy in a meeting.
